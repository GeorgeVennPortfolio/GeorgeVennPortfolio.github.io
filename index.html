        Hello, I'm George 'Npex42' Venn. I'm a British Student, Currently Studying Computer Science At The Wing College
        In Bournemouth. As you may have guessed from the look & feel of this website, I'm heavily interested in 
        working in a basic environment, writing my own tools. My langauge of choice is Rust. I'm most profecient at Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm Currently working on a Low-level Ring-0 Kernel for x86-64 Computers, dubbed 'CobaltOS', written purely in Rust.
        I Have Experience With OpenGL, Game Engine Development, Virtual Machine Development & Write my own Assemblers.
        I'm ALWAYS up for A challenge. Hell, I Started CobaltOS In October 2021 Just because I was bored, and wanted something to do.
        I Love Learning New Things, Hyperfixating & finding Out Everything I can about a Subject. 
    </p>
